# üè° Home Loan Eligibility Calculator
An **AI-powered web application** to predict home loan eligibility and calculate estimated EMIs based on user inputs like gross income, tenure, credit score, age, and more. This project combines **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** with a simple **Flask backend** and **interactive frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)**.

> ‚ö° **Accuracy**: ~85% based on our testing dataset.  
> üìÇ **Model**: Linear Regression  
> üìù **Dataset**: `loan_data.csv` (cleaned and preprocessed)

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ Predict home loan eligibility instantly  
‚úÖ Calculate EMI based on predicted loan amount and interest rate  
‚úÖ Interactive sliders and inputs for real-time feedback  
‚úÖ Clean and responsive UI  
‚úÖ Credit Score, Age, and Employment Type integrated into prediction  
‚úÖ Built with Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn

## üìä Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Python Flask  
- **ML Model**: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)  
- **Model Serving**: joblib  
- **API**: RESTful (Flask)  
- **Extras**: CORS enabled for smooth interaction

## üîß How It Works

1. **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)** collects inputs like:
   - Gross Income (Monthly)
   - Tenure (Years)
   - Interest Rate (% P.A.)
   - Other EMIs (Monthly)
   - Credit Score
   - Age
   - Employment Type

2. Inputs are sent to the Flask backend `/predict` endpoint.

3. **Flask** loads the trained Linear Regression model (`home_loan_model.pkl`).

4. Prediction of **eligible loan amount** is done on the backend.

5. EMI is calculated using the standard **EMI formula**:
   ```
   EMI = [P √ó r √ó (1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n ‚Äì 1]
   ```

6. Results (Loan Eligibility and EMI) are returned to the frontend and displayed in real-time.
