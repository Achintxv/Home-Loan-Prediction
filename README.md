# 🏡 Home Loan Eligibility Calculator
An **AI-powered web application** to predict home loan eligibility and calculate estimated EMIs based on user inputs like gross income, tenure, credit score, age, and more. This project combines **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** with a simple **Flask backend** and **interactive frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)**.

> ⚡ **Accuracy**: ~85% based on our testing dataset.  
> 📂 **Model**: Linear Regression  
> 📝 **Dataset**: `loan_data.csv` (cleaned and preprocessed)

## 🚀 Features

✅ Predict home loan eligibility instantly  
✅ Calculate EMI based on predicted loan amount and interest rate  
✅ Interactive sliders and inputs for real-time feedback  
✅ Clean and responsive UI  
✅ Credit Score, Age, and Employment Type integrated into prediction  
✅ Built with Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn

## 📊 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Python Flask  
- **ML Model**: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)  
- **Model Serving**: joblib  
- **API**: RESTful (Flask)  
- **Extras**: CORS enabled for smooth interaction

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Frontend (HTML/CSS)** collects inputs like:
   - Gross Income (Monthly)
   - Tenure (Years)
   - Interest Rate (% P.A.)
   - Other EMIs (Monthly)
   - Credit Score
   - Age
   - Employment Type

2. Inputs are sent to the Flask backend `/predict` endpoint.

3. **Flask** loads the trained Linear Regression model (`home_loan_model.pkl`).

4. Prediction of **Loan Approval** is done on the backend.

5. Results (Loan Eligibility) are returned to the frontend and displayed in real-time.
